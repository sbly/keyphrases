Screen	 Low resolution of LCD screen. It only has 230000 pixels Canon t2i has 1.02 million pixels. Sometimes when youre viewing playback you may need to zoom in to check the sharpness of the picture or do it with your computer monitor.
Size	The size is pretty big not really an issue for me but it could be in some of the smaller cars out there
Speed	  Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots. Speed	For a period of two weeks I had both cameras in my possession so I could make a direct comparison and decided hands-down that the T2i is the one I will keep.  WhySpeed	I used the same exact settings on both cameras large Jpeg P-mode Quick AF.  Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots.  I used the same class 10 SDHC chip in both cameras but -- this is interesting -- even without any memory chip in the camera the delays are still there.
Battery Life	Battery life is not too great. I need to charge it everyday. To be safe consider to buy an extra Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Nikon D3100 SLR and P7000 Digital Cameras.Battery Life	Battery lifeBattery Life	3. The lens makes noises when youre recording videos using the continuous auto focus function and sometimes its not very accurate. If you buy this camera and this is your concern you can simply use manual focus which is not difficult.4. Battery life is not too great. I need to charge it everyday.

Design	a more toddler friendly seatDesign	adjusting the straps as the kids grow is so easy in comparison to other seats.
Quality	 grain/dull/no detailed photos.Quality	If you want sharp pictures you have to use P S A or M modes with the D3100.

Safety	Safety is obviously my primary concern and this car seat fits really snugly in my car and doesnt move around.Safety	 Im confident that he is safe 
Weight	I love this camera as it does a good job of taking pictures and is not very heavy.  It looks like it should be but does not feel like it is.  It appears to be a very sturdy camera.
LCD Screen	I went for the T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only which is not a huge deal. 
LCD Screen	I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions ie overhead or low to the ground are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.
Installation	My hubby and Father-in-law set this up in about 7 minutes.
Installation	I dont know if anyone else feels this way but trying to install a car seat is just the worst task ever. The process here was like a dream brought to life. The instructions were simple and there was no wondering whether or not you got it right.
Focus	Auto focus in  live view  mode seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder is extremely slow. Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.
Focus	Focus in live picture mode is slow
Comfort	My son fits comfortably in it and has so much room verses his carrier car seat we brought him home in
Service	I emailed customer service with pictures and they sent me a new cover that is a suede-like plush material -- free of charge 
Install	I also find it really easy to install please do read all the directions first but after that time investment I havent had any issues installing it quickly and securely.
Ease Of Installation	My hubby and Father-in-law set this up in about 7 minutes.
Lens	go for a single lens which covers the entire rangeLens	The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens. Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses. And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.Lens	The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade
Auto Lens Mode	 took some picture with the Auto mode and they came out very good.Auto Lens Mode	 I noticed the Auto point and shoot Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for.
Extra Features	Cons If any No Flip-out LCD Not that much of an issue3.7 max burst rate not very fast at allNo audio recording level adjustAlmost no low light auto focus when taking long exposures of moon/stars/light paintingExtra Features	Cons If any No Flip-out LCD Not that much of an issue3.7 max burst rate not very fast at allNo audio recording level adjustAlmost no low light auto focus when taking long exposures of moon/stars/light paintingExtra Features	I chose the t2i over t3i because I didnt feel I would need to use the movable lcd screen and couldnt justify spending that much money on it. If you are condsidering the t3i go ahead and get the 60d. If youd like to see the work I have done with my t2i and 50mm.Extra Features	If you are debating over the T2i vs the T3i there isnt much that is different it is preference whether you need a view finder that moves and if that feature is worth the extra 100.Built-in Flash	Built-in flash is not so great. Also when taking pictures on wide angle setting lens creates a shade.
Functionality	My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE as Ive found so far. As soon as you move up to manual for full control you lose the grid I use the 3x3 which helps me set my composition. Yes I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder but WHY when one is readily available.
T2 Vs T3	T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason onlyT2 Vs T3	same features as the T2i. The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen

Padding Not Good	Seriously disappointed with this carseat  Graco put overall adequate padding in the back part but where the baby sits there is absolutely NO padding.  -So babies only have the carseat covers thickness as padding and thats it. which is a joke to consider  padding  So theyre essentially sitting on the hard plastic.  For the price I expected padding on the ENTIRE carseat and for Graco to not skimp on it.
Rear-facing	If you are going to use it rear facing you do need a rolled up towel or pool noodle underneath this is clear in the instruction booklet.Rear-facing	I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs now that the AAPs new recommendation is to wait till age 2 this seat makes it easy to do so.
Ease Of Cleaning	The material is easy to take off and machine wash when accidents happen.Ease Of Cleaning	he  wings  that I referred to earlier the things that stick out on either side of her head do not clean easily
