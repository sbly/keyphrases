The macro features are also on par with its more advanced and WAY higher priced big brothers to this camera. Adjustable,One disappointment was that the seat cover is made of a material where the velcro on my sons shoes frayed it and the seat cover became scratchy.  I emailed customer service with pictures and they sent me a new cover that is a suede-like plush material -- free of chargeLens,One disappointment was that the seat cover is made of a material where the velcro on my sons shoes frayed it and the seat cover became scratchy.

Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses.Comfortable,. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced and WAY higher priced big brothers to this camera. Now the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW  The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative.Comfortable,My daughter loves this carseat - its very comfortable and appears to be very safe.  Some seats seemed too bulky and I know my daughter would be a sweaty mess in those styles.  This seat seems to breathe so she remains a comfortable temperature while securely strapped in.Material,raco put overall adequate padding in the back part but where the baby sits there is absolutely NO padding.  -So babies only have the carseat covers thickness as padding and thats it. which is a joke to consider  padding  So theyre essentially sitting on the hard plastic.Material,The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens.

This is most frustrating but not often an issue.Comfort,Yes it is a big car seat but safety was my number one priority when upgrading to a toddler car seat so I dont mind the bulk. I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs now that the AAPs new recommendation is to wait till age 2 this seat makes it easy to do so.Comfort, But to much of my suprise the True Fit convertable car seat is amazing.

When the sun is bright it goes straight through the mesh and into the babys eyes. I am constantly trying to move the visor or the stroller to keep the sun out. Whoever thought to use mesh wasnt thinking.Material Is Very Soft Good For Babies,2. Easy to operate. The buttons are spread evenly on left side and right side so you can use them with both hands quickly. For Canon t2i you do most things with your right thumb that slows you down a little bit.3.

After reading many reviews and comparisons I decided on this camera as it is the update to the Nikon D3000 that a friend of mine has.  They love their camera so I figured this was a good choicePrice,The best part was the 1080P video. I took a dance performances of my wife and Kids at local community get together and they came out so good and my wife who is very difficult to please liked it so much that she said that next time we will shoot the video only with our Nikon D3100Price,wait until I read more and experiment. I have taken nature shots portrait shots and sports shots they have all come out amazing. My friends son is Captain of his High School Football team and I have gotten some great shots for him to send to recruiters and colleges now lets talk Value, The best part was the 1080P video.

Among the screen the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not.Breathable,The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen which I use more often for some of the photos I take.

The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not.Build Quality,Built-in flash is not so great. Also when taking pictures on wide angle setting lens creates a shade.- No autofocus when zooming while taking video pressing shutter button half way focuses the picture.- Focus in live picture mode is slow even slower than on most point and shoot camerasAdditional Things Required,The  wings  that I referred to earlier the things that stick out on either side of her head do not clean easily   My daughter puked ALL over her carseat and while the main carseat pad comes off and can be laundered in the machine the part that attaches to the headrest DOES NOT come offInstallation,there is absolutely NO padding.  -So babies only have the carseat covers thickness as padding and thats it. which is a joke to consider  padding  So theyre essentially sitting on the hard plastic.  For the price I expected padding on the ENTIRE carseat and for Graco to not skimp on it.Video Quality,. Even though my son isnt quiet 1 yet he was ready for a more toddler friendly seat. This delivers he isnt leaning back as far and the sides dont cave in next to him. I could tell he liked having things a little roomier the moment I put him in this seat. He still falls asleep with ease.Wide-angle Performance,Battery life seems to be very good - longer than I expected.  The included corded battery charger will appeal to some but not to those who prefer the travel type charger with a swing-out plug.  This is not a professional level SLR but it performs very well as a small light APS-C camera.Accessories,I chose to purchase the camera body separately so that I could pair it with the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM lens.  Although pricey make no mistake this is the ultimate walk-around lens for a crop body camera.  Ive taken some stunning RAW photos and 1080p video with this camera/lens combo.Size For Vehicle,I purchased a Nikon D3100 about a month ago and right out of the box I noticed the Auto point and shoot Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for.

The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.User Comparison,I will not go into extended technical aspects as I am person that is making a transition from an old point and shoot to this DLSR. Camera is just amazing. For a begginer in the professional photography area I definetly see an ocean of difference between the t2i and point and shoot cameras.Features, If you are just starting out are bored with the out of date  point-n-shoot  want to upgrade your digital cams or you want to move from film to digital the T3i will not disappoint. Its an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro this camera really shines.Size,For ease of use IQ form factor it wont weigh me down etc. I feel as if the D3100 was a great purchase. Highly recommended to other newbies who want to get involved with digital photography at a reasonable price - as well as experienced photographers who need a reliable easy to carry backup.Size,Since initially posting Ive purchased these lenses Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras and Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens and really like what the camera can do. Im more and more certain in the 5 stars I put on this review. Really love this cameraWeight, very durable and I love that it has a higher weight limit as well. This also has very nice fabric thats soft to the touch and the buckle system is heavy duty and easy to use as well. Overall a very nice car seat for the price. This is a great option for those of us who cant afford a Britax.Lens,GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE as Ive found so far. As soon as you move up to manual for full control you lose the grid I use the 3x3 which helps me set my composition. Yes I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder but WHY when one is readily available.Lens,pictures looked dull and when I looked at the original file I noticed it was from the amount of grain in the picture.

I emailed customer service with pictures and they sent me a new cover that is a suede-like plush material -- free of charge  I was pleasantly surprised. Picture Quality,The bottom line is that images from the D3100 are indistinguishable from the more expensive models.  Ergonomically the D3100 is the easier to use compared to the D5100 that had to relinquish four buttons to make room for the swivel screen of the D5100.  Following is a link to my review of the D3100Video Quality,the next problem I encountered was trying to get the correct extra base. They tell you to get the base for the snug ride 35 but there is not a level indicator on that base. Therefore when you are installing your snug ride 30 car seat with a snug ride 35 base you cannot tell if the car seat is level.Editing,You would expect Auto Modes to take easy great pictures in an entry level camera most people coming from point and shoot cameras.  If you want sharp pictures you have to use P S A or M modes with the D3100.  There you can control the ISO manually or use Auto ISO and choose a lower maximum ISO setting.Quality,cons the biggest is this darn sun visor.

Plus the seat seams padded well and comfortable for my son.  Ive felt a lot of other car seats out there that feel like theyd be pretty hard to sit on and uncomfortable.Lens,The instructions say to lift the seat pad when threading the belt through which I did but then once the seat was installed I couldnt get the pad back down over the seat where it was against the seat back of the actual vehicle seat.  So I had to uninstall it and reinstall it with the pad in its proper place making it very difficult to do.Lens,I used the same exact settings on both cameras large Jpeg P-mode Quick AF.

The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. Lens,Its my first digital SLR Ive had it for about a year and I love it.  The T3i is out now so thats probably a better bet but I love the fact that I can slowly advance my knowledge of the SLR usage as I go.  Starting off on full auto moving through the different pre-determined settings sports portrait landscape etc and the into the manual modes.Lens,my 2 year old became giddy with excitement. Normally he literally fights and struggles when it is time to get into the the car but not this time. I love this chair  My child is so comfortable and Im confident that he is safe and secure. I dont know if anyone else feels this way but trying to install a car seat is just the worst task ever. TheLens,  I shoot my toddler in continuous mode and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps its supposed to.  It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture.  The T3i however adds frequent and unpredictable delays when  busy  flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.Lens,  Most of these for an 8GB card are 50 or more.

And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.- Performance. Minimal shutter lag good low-light performance nice video.- Relatively light about 1 kg / 2 pounds with lens again good for trips.Lens, have a four year old and a two year old and they both love their true fit seats. Mommy loves them too. They are easy to install especially as compared to the graco one we bought first. The no rethread harness is awesome.

Im just thinking how happy she will be when she gets turned around in a few months. This will even work for newborns. if I had known that I would have gotten this a long time ago.#N/A,The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at 789.99 with the lens kit.Great Lens, The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at 789.99 with the lens kit.It Is Better Then The T3I,Although pricey make no mistake this is the ultimate walk-around lens for a crop body camera.  Ive taken some stunning RAW photos and 1080p video with this camera/lens combo.  Save yourself the headache of working with the kit lens and purchase just the camera body.  Pair it with the lens of your choice but I have no regrets with my 17-55mm purchase.Wireless,I dont know if anyone else feels this way but trying to install a car seat is just the worst task ever. The process here was like a dream brought to life. The instructions were simple and there was no wondering whether or not you got it right. Although the seat is big which I love I was able to fit it easily and securely in the back of my Nissan Sentra.Wireless,We asked for this as a Baby Shower gift back in 2010 when my daughter was born. Started to use it in Feb of this year my daughter is on the small side so she just outgrew the infant seat and LOVE IT  Easy to install via my hubby and my daughter seems to be more pleasant on car rides now that she can sit up and see more out of the windows in the back seat.Cupholder,The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens. Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses. And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.Price Value,We are using this as a rear facing seat in our Chevy Malibu and it fits just fine. Yes it is a big car seat but safety was my number one priority when upgrading to a toddler car seat so I dont mind the bulk. I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs now that the AAPs new recommendation is to wait till age 2 this seat makes it easy to do so.Safety,  the price in amazon is very cheap. I got it for 699  including the VR 55-200mm + camera bag with DVD .  i also used the transcend 32 gb class 10 from amazon for 50 work without any problems . also bought battery at amazon for 27  EN EL 14   way way  amazing purchase. i have probably saved  200-300  i would recommend this to anybody i know who is into DSLR.Features, Auto point and shoot Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for.  The pictures looked dull and when I looked at the original file I noticed it was from the amount of grain in the picture.  The grain was drowning out the details and almost made the picture look out of focus.  It was happening whether I was indoor or outdoor flash or no flashLens,Graco put overall adequate padding in the back part but where the baby sits there is absolutely NO padding.  -So babies only have the carseat covers thickness as padding and thats it. which is a joke to consider  padding  So theyre essentially sitting on the hard plastic.  For the price I expected padding on the ENTIRE carseat and for Graco to not skimp on it.Overall Use And Picture/video Capability,The T2i is FAST.  I shoot my toddler in continuous mode and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps its supposed to.  It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture.  The T3i however adds frequent and unpredictable delays when  busy  flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.Max Burst Rate,y other con is that it was extremely difficult to install it rear facing. Between my 3 kids Ive been through about 6 different convertible car seats in the past 8 years and this one was by far the most difficult to install rear facing with the vehicle belt.  At one point or another Ive had to install all of my previous car seats rear facing with the vehicle belt.Construction,choice.  Unfortunately I have not learned enough to take many pictures off of Auto mode so it acts like a point and shoot.  Compared to my Kodak point and shoot the pictures are great.  I love this camera as it does a good job of taking pictures and is not very heavy.  It looks like it should be but does not feel like it is.  It appears to be a very sturdy camera.Size Of Images,I upgraded from nikon D50 to this. So of course the pictures are much much better.In hindsight The nikon D5100 has a better larger DX sensor vs canon APS sized sensor sensor. So less noise on the Nikon.Also I think that video modes in SLR cameras are fairly useless unless you are good with manual focussing and use the tripod. BTW the lens IS does work in video mode.#N/A,Therefore when you are installing your snug ride 30 car seat with a snug ride 35 base you cannot tell if the car seat is level. After talking to 2 graco representatives the first one told me to  eyeball it  they were able to send me a snug ride 30 base. They claim the new base should be available on the market soon but for now you have to buy it through graco directly.Accesories,One disappointment was that the seat cover is made of a material where the velcro on my sons shoes frayed it and the seat cover became scratchy.  I emailed customer service with pictures and they sent me a new cover that is a suede-like plush material -- free of charge  I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth doing business with companies who please their customers Comfort, I noticed the Auto point and shoot Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for.

The grain was drowning out the details and almost made the picture look out of focus.  It was happening whether I was indoor or outdoor flash or no flashInfant Acceptance, At a glance the camera has a good feel to it and overall has the same features as the T2i. The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen which I use more often for some of the photos I take. Among the screen the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not.User Opinion,everyone tells me that Nikon has a better lenses but when it comes down to it you can buy any lens for your camera. the 600d has better continuous recording you have better manual capabilities. after a lot research i decided to go with the canon i went with a t3i and not a t2i for the flip around screen. i shoot in awkward positions sometimes and it defiantly comes in handy.LCD Screen,After purchasing this seat we took it for a test drive literally with the baby in it.  He seemed very comfortable in it and I liked that the extra deep side wings around the head kept his head from slumping to the side.  I love the no rethread harness and although it took me a bit to figure out how to work it it is still fairly simple and much preferrable over the rethread type.LCD Screen,1. Light weight great body design. Even with my bigger hands I can handle the camera with comfortability.2. Easy to operate. The buttons are spread evenly on left side and right side so you can use them with both hands quickly. For Canon t2i you do most things with your right thumb that slows you down a little bit.3.

Being a beginner in photographyi took much time to decide on models between T2iT3i and 60D. Atlast i bought T3i and i am very much satisfied with the product. Amazon prime helped to get the delivery in a very shortest period which was not imaginable.The only mistake i did was i bought 2 different lens18-55 #N/A,1. Light weight great body design.

I also kept in mind that I have a very specific use for it which is wedding photographySafety,Seriously disappointed with this carseat  Graco put overall adequate padding in the back part but where the baby sits there is absolutely NO padding.  -So babies only have the carseat covers thickness as padding and thats it. which is a joke to consider  padding  So theyre essentially sitting on the hard plastic.

Starting off on full auto moving through the different pre-determined settings sports portrait landscape etc and the into the manual modes.  I figure Im another year or so with this and Ill be ready to upgrade to the 7D and pass this on to my daughter.Comfort,looking seriously at the Canon T2i and the Nikon D3100.  For the money the D3100 cant be beat.  What sold me was the guide mode.  It teaches you how to set up the camera for fantastic shots.  I have learned more using that mode in one week than from the weeks Ive spent reading books and websites.  For the money I saved on the camera I was able to purchase a telephoto lens to go with it.Comfortability,Picture quality on this t2i is stunning so many features that it will take me months to figure out how to really get the most out of this camera. I have done months of research before buying this T2i 18-135mm model and according to the experts there is really not much difference betrween t2i and the t3i. for 150 bucks less I do not need a rotating screen and other minute extended features.User Comfort,ProsBig enough for a toddlerEasy to installComfortable for kids from infant to toddlerNo thread adjustable strapsConsVery bulky. They fit fine in my odyssey mini van but not in my ford focus rear facing. Forward facing they fit in the smaller car ok.Catch a lot of stuff under the paddingCant adjust strap length while in rear facing position. This is most frustrating but not often an issue.Seurity,menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions ie overhead or low to the ground are easily possibleSafety,on.cons the biggest is this darn sun visor. While it is very large the middle section is made of mesh. When the sun is bright it goes straight through the mesh and into the babys eyes. I am constantly trying to move the visor or the stroller to keep the sun out. Whoever thought to use mesh wasnt thinking.  the next problem I encountered was trying to get the correct extra base.

I conducted countless hours of research on Canons Nikons and even Sonys.  I was used to using point-and-shoots and small flip style video cameras to make my videos.  I looked into DSLRs and really wanted a canon.

I purchased two Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC Card TS8GSDHC10 from Amazon and so far these have been amazing.  I have the camera saving in both RAW and JPEG until I can get familiar enough to switch completely to RAW.  Saving in this format is 20MB a picture and this card has no trouble keeping upPerformance,  The seat is gigantic.  When rear facing it would only fit in one postion in my car. I currently live in Japan where my hubby is currently stationed with the USMC.  We drive a large van similar to the old Chevy Astro van.  This seat would onlt fit in the 2nd row in the middle seating position so that it came up almost through the 2 front seats.  I doubt this seat would fit into any other position in any car.Performance,Worse case I would just use it in my husbands car and then order the Britax for my car.  No need for that this seat is great and my son LOVES it   He used to fuss in his carrier/ infant seat but he doesnt at all here.  I am going to order another one of these for my husbands car.  It is so easy to use and install   Bonus- its wallet friendly and in this economy who wouldnt want to save a buck on a great product Lens,.  I drive a Hyundai Sonata so we have decent room in my car for the seat but weve also put it in a friends four runner and my husbands Elantra and it has fit really well in all cars.  It is bigger than a lot of other car seats out there but I also feel like it is really well constructed and pretty comfy.  Safety is obviously my primary concern and this car seat fits really snugly in my car and doesnt move around.Weight, love this chair. from when I opened the box and easly instaled it in the car. it protects my little girl and it provides comfert for her. she use to always scream when even we had to go anywere but with this new saftey 1st car seat she loves it.

The lens makes noises when youre recording videos using the continuous auto focus function and sometimes its not very accurate. If you buy this camera and this is your concern you can simply use manual focus which is not difficult.4. Battery life is not too great. I need to charge it everyday.

The macro features are also on par with its more advanced and WAY higher priced big brothers to this camera. Now the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW  The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative.Weight,Auto focus in  live view  mode seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder is extremely slow. Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.No mode in canon to set Av mode and set min shutter speed while letting the camera pick the ISO. Standard in Nikons. Canon seems to pick the shutter speed based on the zoom focal length selected.Ergonomics,This is a great car seat. I did a lot of research on safety price etc. before buying this one.  I actually bought two one for my car and one for my husbands car.  We were very pleased with it.  Both were delivered super fast and in perfect condition.  Install was exteremly easy and it fit well in both of our cars. Material is easy to clean and comfortable on my babys skin. All I can say is this was a great purchase for our family.Portability,ProsCanon service is apparently better than nikon. Will edit this if this does not turn out to be true. My switch was mostly due to pathetic nikon warranty service.The IS works really well and I think better than nikons which I had tried for a week with a borrowed D5000.Digital 3x zoom in video mode.The 430EX II external flash can be supported by the camera wirelessly. On nikons this is only true for the more expensive SB800s flashes.Safety,Im glad we had the Chicco Keyfit 30 when our guy was an infant. Im sure this is safe enough but I wouldnt want it as an infant seat . . . too inconvenient. Even though my son isnt quiet 1 yet he was ready for a more toddler friendly seat. This delivers he isnt leaning back as far and the sides dont cave in next to him. I could tell he liked having things a little roomier the moment I put him in this seat. He still falls asleep with ease.Cupholder,I purchased a Nikon D3100 about a month ago and right out of the box I noticed the Auto point and shoot Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for.

This is not a professional level SLR but it performs very well as a small light APS-C camera.Comparison To T2i,I researched for several weeks looking seriously at the Canon T2i and the Nikon D3100.  For the money the D3100 cant be beat.  What sold me was the guide mode.  It teaches you how to set up the camera for fantastic shots.  I have learned more using that mode in one week than from the weeks Ive spent reading books and websites.  For the money I saved on the camera I was able to purchase a telephoto lens to go with it.  Worth every penny.  I look forward to many years of great photos.Attributes,though an avid photography enthusiast for many years theres not a lot for me to compare the D3100 to. However my own experience in the short week since I purchased the camera has been extremely gratifying. For ease of use IQ form factor it wont weigh me down etc. I feel as if the D3100 was a great purchase. Highly recommended to other newbies who want to get involved with digital photography at a reasonable price - as well as experienced photographers who need a reliable easy to carry backup.Installation,The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens. Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses. And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.- Performance. Minimal shutter lag good low-light performance nice video.- Relatively light about 1 kg / 2 pounds with lens again good for trips.Install, After testing out all the products I came to the decision that the only cameras I liked that felt good in my hand were the Canon T2i Nikon D5100 and the Can T3i.

The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor.Instal,Pros- The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens. Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses. And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.- Performance. Minimal shutter lag good low-light performance nice video.- Relatively light about 1 kg / 2 pounds with lens again good for trips.Comparison,I looked at many items before pulling the trigger on the Canon T3i. I went to Best buy and tested out the Canon T2i the Nikon D5100 the Canon 60D and the Nikon D7000.

I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only which is not a huge deal. The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at 789.99 with the lens kit.#N/A,I took the camera out to the beach and tested it and was amazed by the Canon T3i quality. I literally took a picture of a surfer 75 Yards away with the kit lens and was able to zoom in in Photoshop and crop an up close beautiful detailed picture of the surfer. The quality is amazing I am upgrading from a Canon XSI and love it. I also took a picture of a cherry tree that was about 30 yards away and then opened it up in Photoshop zoomed in and could see cherries that I could not even see with my eyes from the spot where I took the picture.Safety,the next problem I encountered was trying to get the correct extra base. They tell you to get the base for the snug ride 35 but there is not a level indicator on that base. Therefore when you are installing your snug ride 30 car seat with a snug ride 35 base you cannot tell if the car seat is level. After talking to 2 graco representatives the first one told me to  eyeball it  they were able to send me a snug ride 30 base. They claim the new base should be available on the market soon but for now you have to buy it through graco directly.Comfort,e got this car seat after being very happy with my sons First Years Via car seat.  He was too big already for the extra padding but we had him back facing in this seat for about six months and now have him forward facing.  Hes liked both ways.  I drive a Hyundai Sonata so we have decent room in my car for the seat but weve also put it in a friends four runner and my husbands Elantra and it has fit really well in all cars.  It is bigger than a lot of other car seats out there but I also feel like it is really well constructed and pretty comfyComfort,My daughter puked ALL over her carseat and while the main carseat pad comes off and can be laundered in the machine the part that attaches to the headrest DOES NOT come off and therefore needs to be cleaned by hand.  Thats not so bad since she did not puke on that part except that I was not aware that the headrest pad is attached to another pad that continues down the back behind the main pad   So there is actually quite a big piece that you cannot take off to wash.  Im having quite an interesting time getting the nasty puke smell out of it.Comfort,I researched several SLRs before deciding on the Canon T3i.  Im happy with my choice so far having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art using the Canon 60mm macro lens.  For that use the camera and lens seem to work very well.  I find the ergonomic arrangement of controls on the camera to very very intuitive and pleasant to use.  The camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip. FIt,there is a problem with the D3100 choosing very high ISO levels in Auto Mode no matter the setting.  This is causing the grain/dull/no detailed photos.  You would expect Auto Modes to take easy great pictures in an entry level camera most people coming from point and shoot cameras.  If you want sharp pictures you have to use P S A or M modes with the D3100.  There you can control the ISO manually or use Auto ISO and choose a lower maximum ISO setting.  Apparently this is a discussed firmware issue but Nikon claimed they hadnt heard about it when I messaged themUser Opinion,We love these carseats.  It is a big seat especially rear facing.  We have a Sienna mini van and we had them both on the bench seat.  Unfortunately we had to turn them forward facing before their second birthday because they did not fit backwards. They would have rested on the middle seats.  Other than that it is an awesome seat.  It holds the girls very secure and they love them.  They were pretty easy to install and adjusting the straps as the kids grow is so easy in comparison to other seats. Other than the issues in rear facing position this is a terrific seat.Comfort Safety,a 7D in a crop body with user-friendly controls and the advanced functionality that Canon DSLRs are known for.  I chose to purchase the camera body separately so that I could pair it with the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM lens.  Although pricey make no mistake this is the ultimate walk-around lens for a crop body camera.  Ive taken some stunning RAW photos and 1080p video with this camera/lens combo.  Save yourself the headache of working with the kit lens and purchase just the camera body.  Pair it with the lens of your choice but I have no regrets with my 17-55mm purchase.Comfort And Safety,The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen which I use more often for some of the photos I take. Among the screen the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not. I am a person to read through and learn the various features the camera has to offer. I am impressed with the lens that comes with the camera for the wide angle aspect of it due to a lot of places I shoot pictures there are a lot of people and requires me to get close to get the shot I wantComfort/Safety,In anticipation of the arrival of our third child we bought this car seat to use in our sedan.  We didnt want to buy a new car or invest in all new car seats to make that happen.  We started shopping around and figure that a 17in. wide infant car seat will do.  I believe this is the only one that fits our need.  We are able to use our Britax Marathon a Graco booster and this infant car seat all in one row.  This car seat works out perfectly for us plus we dont need to compromise on quality or style.  It is a well made and designed car seat and the price is very reasonable.Comfort Of Child,ProsBig enough for a toddlerEasy to installComfortable for kids from infant to toddlerNo thread adjustable strapsConsVery bulky. They fit fine in my odyssey mini van but not in my ford focus rear facing. Forward facing they fit in the smaller car ok.Catch a lot of stuff under the paddingCant adjust strap length while in rear facing position. This is most frustrating but not often an issue.Overall we feel both our children are safe and would recommend this for long term use to friends and family members. We are contemplating buying two more so we have matching seats in both vehicles. They are worth every penny.Shutter Speed,Love this car seat   After extensive research and practically being settled on the Britax Advocate I feel like you get what you pay for I was told about this car seat and figured I would give it a try.  Worse case I would just use it in my husbands car and then order the Britax for my car.  No need for that this seat is great and my son LOVES it   He used to fuss in his carrier/ infant seat but he doesnt at all here.  I am going to order another one of these for my husbands car.  It is so easy to use and install   Bonus- its wallet friendly and in this economy who wouldnt want to save a buck on a great product Performance - Speed,My daughter loves this carseat - its very comfortable and appears to be very safe.  Some seats seemed too bulky and I know my daughter would be a sweaty mess in those styles.  This seat seems to breathe so she remains a comfortable temperature while securely strapped in.  The seat is easy to install and buckle her into as well.  This is the second Safety 1st complete Air 65 car seat that we have purchased so we could have one in each car.  I have a baby on the way and know the seat will be durable enough to withstand constant use through 2 children   Of course safety is our main concern but this seat is also stylish Performance,Between my 3 kids Ive been through about 6 different convertible car seats in the past 8 years and this one was by far the most difficult to install rear facing with the vehicle belt.  At one point or another Ive had to install all of my previous car seats rear facing with the vehicle belt.  The instructions say to lift the seat pad when threading the belt through which I did but then once the seat was installed I couldnt get the pad back down over the seat where it was against the seat back of the actual vehicle seat.  So I had to uninstall it and reinstall it with the pad in its proper place making it very difficult to do.Performance,he camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip.  The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions ie overhead or low to the ground are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.Performance,Well I have since done some research and participated in forums and found out there is a problem with the D3100 choosing very high ISO levels in Auto Mode no matter the setting.  This is causing the grain/dull/no detailed photos.  You would expect Auto Modes to take easy great pictures in an entry level camera most people coming from point and shoot cameras.

I can not wait to get Canon 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 EF-S Zoom Lens and than I will be in some serious business.Performance,I took the camera out to the beach and tested it and was amazed by the Canon T3i quality.

Also my son figured out how to snap off the cup holder pretty quickly.  It isnt hard to get back on and it is nice that it pops off so it can go on either side but it is annoying when he gets it off and starts throwing it around.  Of course it would be that or his toys or whatever else he could find if he couldnt get it off.  You do need a seat protector but youd need that with any car seat.  I also dont like some of the colors but that is personal preference.Performance,he  wings  that I referred to earlier the things that stick out on either side of her head do not clean easily   My daughter puked ALL over her carseat and while the main carseat pad comes off and can be laundered in the machine the part that attaches to the headrest DOES NOT come off and therefore needs to be cleaned by hand.

Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.No mode in canon to set Av mode and set min shutter speed while letting the camera pick the ISO. Standard in Nikons. Canon seems to pick the shutter speed based on the zoom focal length selected.White balance in Full auto mode sometimes messes up. Some pictures came out blue-ish.No good priced  normal  50mm/35mm lens available. There is only one 50mm el-cheapo which apparently looks extremely cheap but I will buy it anyway.Video,ConsAuto focus in  live view  mode seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder is extremely slow.

Between my 3 kids Ive been through about 6 different convertible car seats in the past 8 years and this one was by far the most difficult to install rear facing with the vehicle belt.  At one point or another Ive had to install all of my previous car seats rear facing with the vehicle belt.

I have taken nature shots portrait shots and sports shots they have all come out amazing. My friends son is Captain of his High School Football team and I have gotten some great shots for him to send to recruiters and colleges now lets talk Video I have taken alot for Football and I can not believe the quality and sound you would have thought I used a real video camera and not one from a camera it has surpassed what I have expected for a camera I am unbelievably happy with my purchase.Material,The  wings  that I referred to earlier the things that stick out on either side of her head do not clean easily   My daughter puked ALL over her carseat and while the main carseat pad comes off and can be laundered in the machine the part that attaches to the headrest DOES NOT come off and therefore needs to be cleaned by hand.

Started to use it in Feb of this year my daughter is on the small side so she just outgrew the infant seat and LOVE IT  Easy to install via my hubby and my daughter seems to be more pleasant on car rides now that she can sit up and see more out of the windows in the back seat.We ordered another one for this review for my MILs car since she cares for my daughter 2 days a week. Her car is a Honda Civic so it was a little tricky to get it in. Tight fit but does the job its supposed to do. Again my little girl likes being in the seat and able to look out of the windows at the world around her. I would recommend this product to anyone I knew who was in need of a good car seat.Baby Comfort,The car seat was delivered one day after I ordered it online. Which was outstanding. I took it out of the box and my 2 year old became giddy with excitement. Normally he literally fights and struggles when it is time to get into the the car but not this time. I love this chair  My child is so comfortable and Im confident that he is safe and secure. I dont know if anyone else feels this way but trying to install a car seat is just the worst task ever. The process here was like a dream brought to life. The instructions were simple and there was no wondering whether or not you got it right. Although the seat is big which I love I was able to fit it easily and securely in the back of my Nissan Sentra. As for sleeping my little ones head did not hang over once.Memory,This is my first time buying a Digital SLR.  I have mainly used point and shoot cameras in the past and have always had fun taking pictures.  I wanted to start digital photography as a hobby so I decided to buy a nicer camera.  After reading many reviews and comparisons I decided on this camera as it is the update to the Nikon D3000 that a friend of mine has.  They love their camera so I figured this was a good choice.  Unfortunately I have not learned enough to take many pictures off of Auto mode so it acts like a point and shoot.  Compared to my Kodak point and shoot the pictures are great.  I love this camera as it does a good job of taking pictures and is not very heavy.  It looks like it should be but does not feel like it is.  It appears to be a very sturdy camera.Feature Comparison, This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced and WAY higher priced big brothers to this camera. Now the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW  The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out are bored with the out of date  point-n-shoot  want to upgrade your digital cams or you want to move from film to digital the T3i will not disappoint. Its an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro this camera really shines. Oh and the video.....Its 1080p HD nothing more needs to be said.Safety,We are using this as a rear facing seat in our Chevy Malibu and it fits just fine. Yes it is a big car seat but safety was my number one priority when upgrading to a toddler car seat so I dont mind the bulk. I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs now that the AAPs new recommendation is to wait till age 2 this seat makes it easy to do so.Im glad we had the Chicco Keyfit 30 when our guy was an infant. Im sure this is safe enough but I wouldnt want it as an infant seat . . . too inconvenient. Even though my son isnt quiet 1 yet he was ready for a more toddler friendly seat. This delivers he isnt leaning back as far and the sides dont cave in next to him. I could tell he liked having things a little roomier the moment I put him in this seat. He still falls asleep with ease.Safe And Secure,Pros- The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens. Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses. And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.- Performance. Minimal shutter lag good low-light performance nice video.- Relatively light about 1 kg / 2 pounds with lens again good for trips.Cons- Price- Built-in flash is not so great. Also when taking pictures on wide angle setting lens creates a shade.- No autofocus when zooming while taking video pressing shutter button half way focuses the picture.- Focus in live picture mode is slow even slower than on most point and shoot camerasPerformance,Seriously disappointed with this carseat  Graco put overall adequate padding in the back part but where the baby sits there is absolutely NO padding.  -So babies only have the carseat covers thickness as padding and thats it. which is a joke to consider  padding  So theyre essentially sitting on the hard plastic.  For the price I expected padding on the ENTIRE carseat and for Graco to not skimp on it.Additionally with the side impact shaping its a very tight space to use the light blue head rests shown in the listing picture.  I havent tested it out yet but just from the appearance I can tell its not going to work.Ive purchased SnugRides in the past but this is the first one to have a serious lack of adequate padding.  Again for the price would it have REALLY been that expensive for Graco to continue the padding to the SEATPerformance,the biggest is this darn sun visor. While it is very large the middle section is made of mesh. When the sun is bright it goes straight through the mesh and into the babys eyes. I am constantly trying to move the visor or the stroller to keep the sun out. Whoever thought to use mesh wasnt thinking.  the next problem I encountered was trying to get the correct extra base. They tell you to get the base for the snug ride 35 but there is not a level indicator on that base. Therefore when you are installing your snug ride 30 car seat with a snug ride 35 base you cannot tell if the car seat is level. After talking to 2 graco representatives the first one told me to  eyeball it  they were able to send me a snug ride 30 base. They claim the new base should be available on the market soon but for now you have to buy it through graco directlyWeight,cons the biggest is this darn sun visor.

I also dont like some of the colors but that is personal preference.Overall were really happy with this car seat.  It isnt the cheapest seat out there but for how good it is and compared to comparable seats youre getting one heck of a good deal.LCD Screen,I looked at many items before pulling the trigger on the Canon T3i. I went to Best buy and tested out the Canon T2i the Nikon D5100 the Canon 60D and the Nikon D7000. After testing out all the products I came to the decision that the only cameras I liked that felt good in my hand were the Canon T2i Nikon D5100 and the Can T3i. I went for the T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only which is not a huge deal. The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at 789.99 with the lens kit.Articulating LCD Screen,Pros- The 18-135mm lens is a nice upgrade to the standard kit 18-55mm lens. Especially if this is your first DSLR and you dont want to spend more money on lenses. It is also good for trips taking pictures of kids or in any other situation where you dont want to change lenses. And you save about 100 when purchasing this kit compared to body + 18-135mm Canon lens.- Performance. Minimal shutter lag good low-light performance nice video.- Relatively light about 1 kg / 2 pounds with lens again good for trips.Cons- Price- Built-in flash is not so great. Also when taking pictures on wide angle setting lens creates a shade.- No autofocus when zooming while taking video pressing shutter button half way focuses the picture.- Focus in live picture mode is slow even slower than on most point and shoot camerasOther Recommendations- Make sure to get UV filter mostly for protecting the lens and a spare battery Ive got the Opteka one for Durability,I have a four year old and a two year old and they both love their true fit seats. Mommy loves them too. They are easy to install especially as compared to the graco one we bought first. The no rethread harness is awesome. The seat was comfortable looking and big enough rear facing all the way until two years old which is what the apa recommends.ProsBig enough for a toddlerEasy to installComfortable for kids from infant to toddlerNo thread adjustable strapsConsVery bulky. They fit fine in my odyssey mini van but not in my ford focus rear facing. Forward facing they fit in the smaller car ok.Catch a lot of stuff under the paddingCant adjust strap length while in rear facing position. This is most frustrating but not often an issue.Overall we feel both our children are safe and would recommend this for long term use to friends and family members. We are contemplating buying two more so we have matching seats in both vehicles. They are worth every penny.Price,Some of the reviews complain that the Air  wings  cause problems for the kid seeing out but their height is adjustable AND I really like that when my daughter falls asleep they hold her head up so its not bobbing all over the place.The  wings  that I referred to earlier the things that stick out on either side of her head do not clean easily   My daughter puked ALL over her carseat and while the main carseat pad comes off and can be laundered in the machine the part that attaches to the headrest DOES NOT come off and therefore needs to be cleaned by hand.  Thats not so bad since she did not puke on that part except that I was not aware that the headrest pad is attached to another pad that continues down the back behind the main pad   So there is actually quite a big piece that you cannot take off to wash.  Im having quite an interesting time getting the nasty puke smell out of it.All that to say - I still love a lot of things about this carseat but I do NOT love cleaning it.Cost,Pros1. Light weight great body design. Even with my bigger hands I can handle the camera with comfortability.2. Easy to operate. The buttons are spread evenly on left side and right side so you can use them with both hands quickly. For Canon t2i you do most things with your right thumb that slows you down a little bit.3. Takes good quality of videos.4. Very fast auto focus on shooting.Cons1. No wireless remote.2. Low resolution of LCD screen. It only has 230000 pixels Canon t2i has 1.02 million pixels. Sometimes when youre viewing playback you may need to zoom in to check the sharpness of the picture or do it with your computer monitor.3. The lens makes noises when youre recording videos using the continuous auto focus function and sometimes its not very accurate. If you buy this camera and this is your concern you can simply use manual focus which is not difficult.4. Battery life is not too great. I need to charge it everyday. To be safe consider to buy an extra Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Nikon D3100 SLR and P7000 Digital Cameras.Value For Money,ProsCanon service is apparently better than nikon. Will edit this if this does not turn out to be true. My switch was mostly due to pathetic nikon warranty service.The IS works really well and I think better than nikons which I had tried for a week with a borrowed D5000.Digital 3x zoom in video mode.The 430EX II external flash can be supported by the camera wirelessly. On nikons this is only true for the more expensive SB800s flashes.ConsAuto focus in  live view  mode seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder is extremely slow. Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.No mode in canon to set Av mode and set min shutter speed while letting the camera pick the ISO. Standard in Nikons. Canon seems to pick the shutter speed based on the zoom focal length selected.White balance in Full auto mode sometimes messes up. Some pictures came out blue-ish.No good priced  normal  50mm/35mm lens available. There is only one 50mm el-cheapo which apparently looks extremely cheap but I will buy it anyway.Installation,This camera/lens kit is probably the best you can get for the money.  I conducted countless hours of research on Canons Nikons and even Sonys.  I was used to using point-and-shoots and small flip style video cameras to make my videos.  I looked into DSLRs and really wanted a canon.  YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS CAMERA   It is great for intermediate shooters who want to get their first or second DSLR.  It is very user Friendly and Fun to use.PROSFULL HD VIDEO RECORDING60fps HD Recording AMAZING slow motion Manual video controlsMic input18MP Stills  best for the money competitors are usually 16MPBuilt in image stabilizer 18-55mm lensSomewhat Compact sizeEase of useFast start up speed I have caught videos with this camera seconds away from missing a fast moving skate turns on in about 1 secondPRICE since the T3i came out this camera is going down in price but essentially is the same camera as the T3iCons If any No Flip-out LCD Not that much of an issue3.7 max burst rate not very fast at allNo audio recording level adjustAlmost no low light auto focus when taking long exposures of moon/stars/light paintingSafety,The seat is gigantic.  When rear facing it would only fit in one postion in my car. I currently live in Japan where my hubby is currently stationed with the USMC.  We drive a large van similar to the old Chevy Astro van.  This seat would onlt fit in the 2nd row in the middle seating position so that it came up almost through the 2 front seats.  I doubt this seat would fit into any other position in any car.  My other con is that it was extremely difficult to install it rear facing. Between my 3 kids Ive been through about 6 different convertible car seats in the past 8 years and this one was by far the most difficult to install rear facing with the vehicle belt.  At one point or another Ive had to install all of my previous car seats rear facing with the vehicle belt.  The instructions say to lift the seat pad when threading the belt through which I did but then once the seat was installed I couldnt get the pad back down over the seat where it was against the seat back of the actual vehicle seat.  So I had to uninstall it and reinstall it with the pad in its proper place making it very difficult to do.Durable,I will make a brief of my own experience of this camera to DSLR beginnersPros1.

To be safe consider to buy an extra Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Nikon D3100 SLR and P7000 Digital Cameras.Price,Ill inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasnt necessary yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. Ill be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months as well as trying out the IS lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced and WAY higher priced big brothers to this camera. Now the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW  The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out are bored with the out of date  point-n-shoot  want to upgrade your digital cams or you want to move from film to digital the T3i will not disappoint. Its an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro this camera really shines. Oh and the video.....Its 1080p HD nothing more needs to be said. Canon yoPrice,We are using this as a rear facing seat in our Chevy Malibu and it fits just fine. Yes it is a big car seat but safety was my number one priority when upgrading to a toddler car seat so I dont mind the bulk. I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs now that the AAPs new recommendation is to wait till age 2 this seat makes it easy to do so.Im glad we had the Chicco Keyfit 30 when our guy was an infant. Im sure this is safe enough but I wouldnt want it as an infant seat . . . too inconvenient. Even though my son isnt quiet 1 yet he was ready for a more toddler friendly seat. This delivers he isnt leaning back as far and the sides dont cave in next to him. I could tell he liked having things a little roomier the moment I put him in this seat. He still falls asleep with ease.The cup holder isnt pictured but there is a detachable one in the box. The material is easy to take off and machine wash when accidents happen.My hubby and Father-in-law set this up in about 7 minutes. If you are going to use it rear facing you do need a rolled up towel or pool noodle underneath this is clear in the instruction booklet.Overall Im very satisfied with my purchase.Material,Since I have switched from Nikon to Canon a lot of my review is based on comparison to Nikon.ProsCanon service is apparently better than nikon.

It takes my husband less than 2 minutes.  excellent padding and very nice soft fabric. I rolled some burp cloths on the side to stabilize his head while hes still small. May be regretting the black fabric in Texas summers though.  light weight and fits well in the middle seat in my midsize infiniti.

While it is very large the middle section is made of mesh. When the sun is bright it goes straight through the mesh and into the babys eyes. I am constantly trying to move the visor or the stroller to keep the sun out. Whoever thought to use mesh wasnt thinking.  the next problem I encountered was trying to get the correct extra base. They tell you to get the base for the snug ride 35 but there is not a level indicator on that base. Therefore when you are installing your snug ride 30 car seat with a snug ride 35 base you cannot tell if the car seat is level. After talking to 2 graco representatives the first one told me to  eyeball it  they were able to send me a snug ride 30 base. They claim the new base should be available on the market soon but for now you have to buy it through graco directly.Cleaning,ros VERY easy to install base in car.

Im happy with my choice so far having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art using the Canon 60mm macro lens.  For that use the camera and lens seem to work very well.  I find the ergonomic arrangement of controls on the camera to very very intuitive and pleasant to use.  The camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip.  The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions ie overhead or low to the ground are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.  The camera comes with a comfortable good quality neck strap and is quite light and small compared to other SLRs. Battery life seems to be very good - longer than I expected.  The included corded battery charger will appeal to some but not to those who prefer the travel type charger with a swing-out plug.  This is not a professional level SLR but it performs very well as a small light APS-C camera.Clean,Pros1. Light weight great body design. Even with my bigger hands I can handle the camera with comfortability.2. Easy to operate. The buttons are spread evenly on left side and right side so you can use them with both hands quickly.

To be safe consider to buy an extra Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Nikon D3100 SLR and P7000 Digital Cameras.Overall this is an incredible camera. You will not regret it.In addition if youd love to take beautiful portraits for your beloved ones Id highly recommend you to also get a Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. It can be used to take short range portraits close-ups and indoors where the light is insufficient. I am not doing ads for Nikon or Amazon but you will really find the lens worth your investment.Removable Fabric, have been using the graco snug ride 30 metropolis for 2 months now. So far I am only satisfied with this car seat.pros VERY easy to install base in car. It takes my husband less than 2 minutes.  excellent padding and very nice soft fabric.

After purchasing this seat we took it for a test drive literally with the baby in it.  He seemed very comfortable in it and I liked that the extra deep side wings around the head kept his head from slumping to the side.  I love the no rethread harness and although it took me a bit to figure out how to work it it is still fairly simple and much preferrable over the rethread type.Now for the cons.  The seat is gigantic.  When rear facing it would only fit in one postion in my car. I currently live in Japan where my hubby is currently stationed with the USMC.  We drive a large van similar to the old Chevy Astro van.  This seat would onlt fit in the 2nd row in the middle seating position so that it came up almost through the 2 front seats.  I doubt this seat would fit into any other position in any car.  My other con is that it was extremely difficult to install it rear facing. Between my 3 kids Ive been through about 6 different convertible car seats in the past 8 years and this one was by far the most difficult to install rear facing with the vehicle belt.  At one point or another Ive had to install all of my previous car seats rear facing with the vehicle belt.  The instructions say to lift the seat pad when threading the belt through which I did but then once the seat was installed I couldnt get the pad back down over the seat where it was against the seat back of the actual vehicle seat.  So I had to uninstall it and reinstall it with the pad in its proper place making it very difficult to do.Ease Of Cleaning,We got this car seat after being very happy with my sons First Years Via car seat.  He was too big already for the extra padding but we had him back facing in this seat for about six months and now have him forward facing.  Hes liked both ways.  I drive a Hyundai Sonata so we have decent room in my car for the seat but weve also put it in a friends four runner and my husbands Elantra and it has fit really well in all cars.  It is bigger than a lot of other car seats out there but I also feel like it is really well constructed and pretty comfy.  Safety is obviously my primary concern and this car seat fits really snugly in my car and doesnt move around.  I also find it really easy to install please do read all the directions first but after that time investment I havent had any issues installing it quickly and securely.  Plus the seat seams padded well and comfortable for my son.  Ive felt a lot of other car seats out there that feel like theyd be pretty hard to sit on and uncomfortable.A few things I dont like but not many.  The size is pretty big not really an issue for me but it could be in some of the smaller cars out there although it does fit just fine in my husbands Elantra and that isnt a huge car.  Also my son figured out how to snap off the cup holder pretty quickly.  It isnt hard to get back on and it is nice that it pops off so it can go on either side but it is annoying when he gets it off and starts throwing it around.  Of course it would be that or his toys or whatever else he could find if he couldnt get it off.  You do need a seat protector but youd need that with any car seat.  I also dont like some of the colors but that is personal preference.Overall were really happy with this car seat.  It isnt the cheapest seat out there but for how good it is and compared to comparable seats youre getting one heck of a good deal.Material Cleaning,I bought this seat for my son who is now 8 months old.  I got it because I already have the Safety 1st Air Protect On Board 35 SE Infant Car Seat which I love.  My son is still in his infant car seat but not for much longer.  I love that this seat has such a high rear facing weight and height limit.  It is so high in fact that my 3 1/2 year old would still be able to be rear facing in this seat.  Rear facing is the safest way for small children to travel when in a car.  After purchasing this seat we took it for a test drive literally with the baby in it.  He seemed very comfortable in it and I liked that the extra deep side wings around the head kept his head from slumping to the side.
